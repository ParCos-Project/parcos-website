					<description><![CDATA[<p>In this case study by <a href="https://kwmc.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Knowle West Media Centre</a> (KWMC), young people had the chance to explore the data behind air pollution levels in their local neighbourhoods through Minecraft.</p>
<p>Grounded in their <a href="https://www.bristolapproach.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bristol Approach</a>, KWMC addresses complex issues in a people- and community-centred way by involving those with firsthand experiences in finding solutions. Although young people are affected by these complex problems, such as poor air quality, as well, it is not always evident to include them in the problem-solving process.&#8230; <a href="https://parcos-project.eu/2023/02/telling-data-stories-through-minecraft-air-pollution/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>As part of the citizen science project AstroSounds, VRT worked together with students of LUCA School of Arts to create short, animated videos for public displays that deliver the scientific story in an engaging way to a broader audience. The videos were shown on public screens in the library Tweebronnen in Leuven and accompanied the physical installation of citizen science project <a href="https://www.astrosounds.be">AstroSounds</a>.&#8230; <a href="https://parcos-project.eu/2022/03/exploring-public-displays-to-bring-scientific-information-to-a-broader-audience/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The Flemish citizen science project <a href="https://www.astrosounds.be">AstroSounds</a> launches a call to Flemish citizens to listen to stars. In this way, citizens can help scientific research. As of January 11, 2022, visitors can discover AstroSounds (in Dutch) via a physical installation in the Tweebronnen Library in Leuven, as part of the KNAL! City Festival. Linked to the installation is a Belgian case study within the ParCos project, that aims to research how vertical video content on public screens can inform and engage people with science stories.&#8230; <a href="https://parcos-project.eu/2022/01/engaging-citizens-to-become-star-listeners/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>
