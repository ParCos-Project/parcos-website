					<description><![CDATA[<p>From September 2021 till January 2022, 17 students of Media and Information Design (LUCA School of Arts, campus Brussels, Belgium) created a wide range of participatory data stories on the topic of climate change. These third year Bachelor students were already trained at designing data visualisations, from creating non-fictional stories to shaping interaction design. For this assignment, they were asked to bring their design skills together.&#8230; <a href="https://parcos-project.eu/2022/06/student-assignment-on-creating-data-stories-with-different-levels-of-participation/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The Flemish citizen science project <a href="https://www.astrosounds.be">AstroSounds</a> launches a call to Flemish citizens to listen to stars. In this way, citizens can help scientific research. As of January 11, 2022, visitors can discover AstroSounds (in Dutch) via a physical installation in the Tweebronnen Library in Leuven, as part of the KNAL! City Festival. Linked to the installation is a Belgian case study within the ParCos project, that aims to research how vertical video content on public screens can inform and engage people with science stories.&#8230; <a href="https://parcos-project.eu/2022/01/engaging-citizens-to-become-star-listeners/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>

<p>As the Flemish public broadcaster, VRT aims to inform, inspire, and connect all Flemish citizens. In today’s everchanging media landscape, emerging technologies define new circumstances for getting your message across. This brings with it significant challenges when the story you want to tell is not a straightforward one. To collect some insights and best practices, we asked vlogger Jacotte Brokken to interview colleagues at VRT about their approach for communicating science stories.&#160;&#8230; <a href="https://parcos-project.eu/2021/12/science-communication-for-everyone-by-everyone/" class="read-more">Read more </a></p>
