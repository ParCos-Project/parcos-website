Details will be made available to participants nearer the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Background<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In our increasingly data-driven world, humans should be enabled to engage with data in order to facilitate data sensemaking. In fact, understanding environmental data allows us to better understand our surroundings and build empathy with its requirements and challenges. In this workshop, we will explore&nbsp;a number of&nbsp;arts-based, creative and playful approaches to support data interpretation of civic data sets. Participants will deploy these approaches to overcome data literacy issues and build empathy through data.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Goals of the workshop<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal of this workshop is to explore how to&nbsp;improve data inclusivity and empowerment&nbsp;by minimizing the barriers that people may face in their encounters with data, whilst at the same time making data more fun to use. As a first step, we will consider some arts-based and creative approaches to data sensemaking that are part of ongoing work of the&nbsp;organisers. Next, we will collectively explore how to extend these approaches, combining the existing knowledge of&nbsp;organisers&nbsp;with knowledge and cases brought by other participants. This will occur through interactive activities that aim to answer questions, such as:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>What are the&nbsp;<em>most critical<\/em>&nbsp;barriers against data inclusivity and empowerment?&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"2\"><li>Which barriers are best overcome by arts-based, creative and playful approaches and which ones are better tackled through alternative means?&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"3\"><li>What is the role does data play in building empathy towards others and the environment and what methods can support such empathy building?&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"4\"><li>How to critically reflect participatory approaches concerning data in order to avoid&nbsp;organising&nbsp;pseudo participation: how to reflect the ownership and agency of the people\/communities involved in collecting and making sense of data.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to participate<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To participate please submit a position paper by <em>20 May 2021<\/em>. The position paper can be text (minimum 1 page, in any format), sketches, photos, videos, speculative designs or any artefact that you think will demonstrate your interest or existing research related to the theme of the workshop &#8220;Data Inclusion and Empowerment through Arts-Based, Creative and Playful Approaches&#8221;.  You may submit your paper as a link to online content (e.g. video), if appropriate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Topics of interest include:<br>\u2022 Narrative principles supporting data exploration<br>\u2022 Creative data literacies<br>\u2022 Playful data exploration<br>\u2022 Data as interactive art and museum exhibits<br>\u2022 Data through the senses: data physicalisation, sonofication, embodiment<br>\u2022 Data drama: understanding and communicating data through role play, improvisation, dance<br>\u2022 Data stories through sketching, comics, poetry<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Submissions should be made by email by 20 May 2021 (AOE) to: natasha.tylosky[at]lut.fi<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Activities<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The workshop is scheduled for one full day. Activities will include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Research exchange<\/strong>. The first part of the day will consist of a fast-paced research exchange where participants will get to know each other by sharing three key facts about their research. Papers\/artefacts will be made available for all participants in the shared workshop space online and participants will be invited to read through them before the start of the workshop.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Participating with existing approaches<\/strong>. Participants will have the possibility to try out using a range of arts-based, creative and playful approaches for making sense of civic data sets, including roleplaying, improvisation, embodiment, sonification, physicalisation, narrativity, and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sandpit<\/strong>. Using data and stories brought by the organisers, the participants will have a chance to ideate, co-design and test out new arts-based and narrative methods for exploring and\/or communicating with data. They could make sketches, short videos, clickable mockups or similar to convey their ideas. The organisers will suggest free and (where possible) online tools for these activities. Roughly, this will be structured as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Participants have a 45 minute break to come up with ideas on their own<\/li><li>Participants work in groups to discuss and critique ideas, choosing one or more that they want to prototype<\/li><li>Prototyping time: participants will work on rapidly prototyping their method.<\/li><li>Share and test: groups will share and test their ideas with other groups.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>Organisers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Natasha&nbsp;Tylosky<\/strong>&nbsp;is a researcher in Human Computer Interaction in the Department of Software Engineering at LUT University. She has a background in game design, interaction design and graphic design. In 2019 she completed her&nbsp;masters&nbsp;degree in Cognitive Systems and Interactive Media at the University of Pompeu Fabra. Natasha is interested in the intersection between art, data and science communication, and how we can apply art and game design techniques to science communication. Her research focuses on how scientific data can be communicated to the general public through interactive data visualizations, data storytelling and gamification. Natasha is currently&nbsp;pursing&nbsp;a PHD at LUT focusing on how emotional design can influence engagement with interactive data visualization.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Priscilla Van Even<\/strong>&nbsp;is a researcher at the Meaningful Interactions Lab (Mintlab) of the KU Leuven. In her research she focuses on the development of a framework for meaningful science communication. Furthermore, she taught research methodology at the University of Leuven, is experienced in the education of young (and&nbsp;adult) people and holds a position as a museum educator in the Musical Instrument Museum and the Royal Museum of Art and History in Brussels.
