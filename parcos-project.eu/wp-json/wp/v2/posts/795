The graduate seminars were led by several universities, namely: Venice Internation University (Italy), Stellenbosch University (South Africa), University of Padua (Italy), KU Leuven (Belgium), and Ca\u2019Foscari University of Venice (Italy).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the 14th of September, the ParCos team organized several activities such as lectures and participatory workshops. During one of these workshops, they introduced the <a href=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/train-the-trainers-package\/\">ParCos Trainer Cards<\/a>: a self-reflexive tool for the development and evaluation of science stories. The participating students were asked to use these Trainer Cards to evaluate or iterate the science story that they had developed in group during an earlier activity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:50%\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"466\" height=\"622\" src=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-797\" srcset=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image.png 466w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-225x300.png 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 466px) 100vw, 466px\" \/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:50%\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-1.png\" alt=\"This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is image-1.png\"\/><\/figure>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Experiences and Impressions of Mintlab&#8217;s participants<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:50%\">\n<p>\u201c<em>Before attending the VIU seminar, my experiences with science communication were limited. By participating in the various interactive and informative workshops, especially in the courses on the core theories and models of science communication and scientific co-design, I have now discovered many points of convergence with my own research on menstrual self-tracking apps in the Chinese context. In particular, the seminar has enabled me to extend my current understanding of Chinese science communication and support more theory-driven science communication conceptualizations and research. I now feel confident to move from a mere public understanding of science communication, towards a combination of understanding and science participation.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; Jiamin Li<\/p>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:50%\">\n<p>\u201c<em>Thanks to VIU, I got the opportunity to think together with other, social and non-social scientists about the ways my PhD research can&nbsp;really matter to&nbsp;the&nbsp;societal stakeholders&nbsp;I\u2019m working with.
