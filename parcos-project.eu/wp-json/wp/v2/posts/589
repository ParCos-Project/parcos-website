These third year Bachelor students were already trained at designing data visualisations, from creating non-fictional stories to shaping interaction design. For this assignment, they were asked to bring their design skills together. The process was guided by the<a href=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/parcos-storyteller\/\"> ParCos Storyteller<\/a>: a ParCos tool for guiding participation in data storytelling. Students were introduced to existing data stories that ranged from inviting the audience to interpret data and discover storyline(s) (see Figure 1 below, left), to participating in the story by contributing data, or even adding their own data story(line) (see Figure 1, right).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"248\" src=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Schermafbeelding-2022-06-22-om-11.18.32-1-1024x248.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-615\" srcset=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Schermafbeelding-2022-06-22-om-11.18.32-1-1024x248.png 1024w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Schermafbeelding-2022-06-22-om-11.18.32-1-300x73.png 300w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Schermafbeelding-2022-06-22-om-11.18.32-1-768x186.png 768w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Schermafbeelding-2022-06-22-om-11.18.32-1-1536x372.png 1536w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Schermafbeelding-2022-06-22-om-11.18.32-1.png 2024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px\" \/><figcaption>Figure 1.

To mitigate these inequalities, participatory data stories can provide a stepping stone to engage themselves with the issue through data, enabling them to raise their voice.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"265\" src=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/LUCA-students-1024x265.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-617\" srcset=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/LUCA-students-1024x265.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/LUCA-students-300x78.jpg 300w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/LUCA-students-768x199.jpg 768w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/LUCA-students.jpg 1390w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px\" \/><figcaption>Figure 2. Students of 3BA Media &amp; Information Design, LUCA School of Arts.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Climate change is a huge and multi-faceted issue, and the students were left free to explore any journalistic angle for a story, as well as a fitting medium. Results ranged from interactive websites to installations, physical books, and card games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Participatory Data Stories<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>0. Consume data story<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For a story to be participatory, it should at least allow for (inter-)activity. For example, consumers of the story should be able to easily retrieve a data source to further discover information or check the trustworthiness of the source.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this level, none of such links are provided. Stories are created to be consumed <strong>without any active participation<\/strong> of viewer, reader or listener. Examples in this level are explainer videos or non-interactive graphs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We present this category to demonstrate how it differentiates from the other levels. However, students did not create any examples of this (as the assignment explicitly requested triggering some kind of active participation by the target audience).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1. Interpret data to discover storyline<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, examples of data visualisation in an online journalistic context allow for <strong>some kind of interactivity<\/strong>, such as by filtering categories or zooming in and out. This activity allows for the news consumer to be involved in the interpretation, although it might be very limited.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Student Mattia Gentile explored the well-established journalistic scrollytelling format, in which the viewer is free to skip through text, images and graphs to learn about the topic of hybrid teleworking or schooling and how it affects the environment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"603\" src=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Schermafbeelding-2022-06-22-om-12.06.03-1-1024x603.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-619\" srcset=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Schermafbeelding-2022-06-22-om-12.06.03-1-1024x603.png 1024w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Schermafbeelding-2022-06-22-om-12.06.03-1-300x177.png 300w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Schermafbeelding-2022-06-22-om-12.06.03-1-768x453.png 768w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Schermafbeelding-2022-06-22-om-12.06.03-1.png 1220w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"539\" src=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Schermafbeelding-2022-06-22-om-12.06.16-1-1024x539.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-620\" srcset=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Schermafbeelding-2022-06-22-om-12.06.16-1-1024x539.png 1024w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Schermafbeelding-2022-06-22-om-12.06.16-1-300x158.png 300w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Schermafbeelding-2022-06-22-om-12.06.16-1-768x405.png 768w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Schermafbeelding-2022-06-22-om-12.06.16-1.png 1234w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Students also explored less typical media formats. Here, two projects were presented: a data story card game and a data story object.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Student Ines Germeau designed a quartet card game on the impact of food production on climate change. This game focuses on children between 8-12 years old. In each of the quartets, she highlights one particular food group, such as meat, fish, wheats and vegetables. Children can puzzle data on the climate impact together and construct a coherent data story. This way, children are actively interpreting the data at hand.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"725\" height=\"575\" src=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Quartet.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-621\" srcset=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Quartet.png 725w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Quartet-300x238.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Data story objects are a way to bring data stories in a surprising way to an audience. With the project of student Maureen Durviaux, we are invited to construct a chair as if it were a story. In the furniture\u2019s pieces, different data graphs on the impact of furniture waste on the climate are hidden. The audience is thus invited to construct the data story together with the actual object; the chair.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Prototype Furniture waste\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/669158380?h=96097b8918&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"525\" height=\"295\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Interpret data to progress storyline<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While the first level cluster of stories facilitate viewers to interpret data as a way to reveal the story, this second level beholds a factor of surprise. Here, data interpretation may also lead to <strong>additional data or additional story viewpoints<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project of student Simon Nelissen departs from an interactive data story on the impact of shell-picking at the beach on the environment. Viewers can scroll through this story via a mobile website and explore underlying data and information sources. The story is complemented with an intervention on the beach. The student spread hundreds of bright blue seashells that visitors on the beach could encounter and that link to a mobile story. This way, visitors are not only invited to interpret the data sources, they are also invited to provide their geo-data on where and when it was found, which, all together, adds a new storyline to the existing story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-9-16 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"WIPSPFS\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/668132817?h=2bdca5be98&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"443\" height=\"788\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. Add data to storyline<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On this level, story consumers are also invited to<strong> consciously contribute data to the data story<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Student Sam Evers designed the Litter Calculator, which is an urban intervention that encourages passers-by to pick up litter that surrounds the installation and learn how long it takes to break down the material of the litter. For example, plastic will never break off while paper would take a couple of months. The student used Machine Learning to develop the intervention. She also programmed the installation to capture and log all of the incoming litter. This way, a data story of local litter is generated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"628\" src=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Litter-data-story-1024x628.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-622\" srcset=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Litter-data-story-1024x628.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Litter-data-story-300x184.jpg 300w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Litter-data-story-768x471.jpg 768w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Litter-data-story.jpg 1390w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>4. Add data storyline<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, ultimate participation is achieved when viewers <strong>contribute their own data story<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Student Elise Reuschel created a booklet for children of 10-12 years old. This book shares a data story on how their behaviour at home impacts climate change, and how they can contribute by behaving differently. The book also allows children to keep track of their behaviour by manually logging different personal data points, such as whether they switch off the lights or not. Children are also invited to reflect on the data story through drawing and coming up with solutions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"769\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Climate-data-story-1-769x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-624\" srcset=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Climate-data-story-1-769x1024.jpg 769w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Climate-data-story-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Climate-data-story-1-768x1023.jpg 768w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Climate-data-story-1-1153x1536.jpg 1153w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/Climate-data-story-1.jpg 1390w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>Other projects in the first level (data interpretation to discover storyline) include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Exploding Earth (Maarten Vandevelde)<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Because climate change is a complex topic, I created a card game to stimulate conversation.

My target audience is a younger audience: the youth. Because climate change is everywhere and is talked about all the time, some people are getting sick of the talks (definitely the younger generation, whose main focus is not climate change). I wanted my story to be a little more subtle. In addition to the younger target group I focused on those that use the car unnecessarily a lot; car enthusiasts , race fans, \u2026 With a data story on motorsport I wanted to show that the big guys are also thinking about the climate. To make it more subtle, I thought of a toy car that you could decorate with stickers and colours of companies that make a change in motorsport by focusing on climate change. The stickers are advent-like hidden under pieces of information on a poster so the designers first needs to look at the information and then reveal the stickers.
