How does waste affect our planet?&nbsp;<br>2. Plastics &#8211; Exploring recycled and bio plastics&nbsp;<br>3. Paper \u2013 Tackling waste through Design Thinking (with sustainable designer Lisa Cole)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In advance of the sessions, participants received a package of supplies including ingredients, tools and safety clothing to make \u2018bioplastic\u2019 pots out of pine resin; and fabric and sewing supplies to make reusable cloths. In addition, participants completed household waste audits so they could compare data as part of a community data set.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"982\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/ReThinkReMakeReCycle_Participant-Packs1-982x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-220\" srcset=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/ReThinkReMakeReCycle_Participant-Packs1-982x1024.png 982w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/ReThinkReMakeReCycle_Participant-Packs1-288x300.png 288w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/ReThinkReMakeReCycle_Participant-Packs1-768x801.png 768w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/ReThinkReMakeReCycle_Participant-Packs1.png 1105w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px\" \/><figcaption>The packages for participants<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sharing Stories<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In March 2021, KWMC launched a free digital zine, which includes a range of tutorials, activities, stories and puzzles inspired by&nbsp;the workshops. The zine launch coincided with Global Recycling Day on Thursday 18 March 2021, an annual event organised by&nbsp;The Global Recycling Foundation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The zine was collated and created by university graduate Chelsea Galloway as part of a communications internship with KWMC.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chelsea suggested creating an interactive zine, rather than a formal report or static webpage, in order to \u201cdocument the sessions, gather participants\u2019 contributions and collect data from waste audits in a fun, visual way.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"840\" height=\"596\" src=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/ReThink-ReMake-ReCycle-Zine_Page_131-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"222\" data-full-url=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/ReThink-ReMake-ReCycle-Zine_Page_131-1.jpg\" data-link=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/?attachment_id=222\" class=\"wp-image-222\" srcset=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/ReThink-ReMake-ReCycle-Zine_Page_131-1.jpg 840w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/ReThink-ReMake-ReCycle-Zine_Page_131-1-300x213.jpg 300w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/ReThink-ReMake-ReCycle-Zine_Page_131-1-768x545.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px\" \/><\/figure><\/li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"840\" height=\"596\" src=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/ReThink-ReMake-ReCycle-Zine_Page_141.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"223\" data-full-url=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/ReThink-ReMake-ReCycle-Zine_Page_141.jpg\" data-link=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/?attachment_id=223\" class=\"wp-image-223\" srcset=\"https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/ReThink-ReMake-ReCycle-Zine_Page_141.jpg 840w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/ReThink-ReMake-ReCycle-Zine_Page_141-300x213.jpg 300w, https:\/\/parcos-project.eu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/ReThink-ReMake-ReCycle-Zine_Page_141-768x545.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px\" \/><\/figure><\/li><\/ul><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 36-page zine incorporates the notes and reflections that participants recorded on a shared Google Jamboard, and the data, tips and stories they shared. These include creative ideas for reducing paper waste, things participants already do at home to live sustainably, and the items they threw away in a one-week period. Chelsea reflects that \u201cpeople\u2019s words shape[d] the content\u201d of the zine.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as sharing data and stories in an accessible, family-friendly way, the zine offers a starting point for readers to explore their own experiences. Chelsea explains that the zine was designed to show what the participants had explored together and pose the question, \u201cwhat are you up to?\u201d \u2013 highlighting that people are \u201con different sustainability journeys.\u201d She adds: \u201cthe interactive elements of the zine enable people to join in \u2013 either typing directly into the digital document or printing the zine at home to write on by hand.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Readers are also encouraged to engage with participants\u2019 waste data and draw their own conclusions. On the final page of the zine, the data is represented visually in the form of a puzzle (see image) so readers can count the items and interpret the data themselves.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since its launch, the zine has been featured in a range of blogs and e-newsletters which focus on community action and sustainability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What\u2019s next?<\/strong><strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021 KWMC is planning further family-friendly workshops with recycled and bio materials, and exploring collaborations with researchers and companies working in these areas. KWMC will also research and prototype creative ways to collect, visualise and communicate data about household waste, recycling and repurposing, such as interactive games, animatronics and digital installations.&nbsp;The team will also work with people to teach and support them to create and share their own stories and engage others in exploring the stories and the data behind them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can read and download the zine via <a href=\"https:\/\/kwmc.org.uk\/projects\/rethink-remake-recycle-waste\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/kwmc.org.uk\/projects\/rethink-remake-recycle-waste\/ <\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information about KWMC\u2019s work on ParCos visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/kwmc.org.uk\/projects\/parcos\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/kwmc.org.uk\/projects\/parcos\/<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ReThink ReMake ReCycle workshops were also part of the Bristol+Bath Creative R+D Inclusion Programme (<a href=\"https:\/\/bristolbathcreative.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/bristolbathcreative.org\/<\/a>).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As part of the UK pilot of ParCos, Knowle West Media Centre (KWMC) has been working with people in Bristol to understand the scale and impact of household waste and explore creative solutions to the problem.
