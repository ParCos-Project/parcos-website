This led to the creation of <strong>interactive data comics<\/strong> \u2013 inspired by the work of Bach et al., 2018 &#8211; embedded in a narrative that framed the experience for participants. The narrative told that a mythical character called N\u00e4kkit\u00e4r had travelled back in time to the present day, because she needed help to understand why some of the water quality in the lake where she lied was so bad whereas other water was good. She had access to a lot of data about the lake but had no way to make sense of it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cN\u00e4kkit\u00e4r, here she is,&nbsp;N\u00e4kkit\u00e4r, the all-seeing being who can always sense beyond the present into the future and the past&#8230; until now.

There is a latent criticality in the arts. When used in certain ways, <strong>it can make visible what is not seen<\/strong>. It is often assumed that data is objective, without market-driven or other political interests, claiming it is evidence-driven. As citizens, we should have access to tools that can help interpret and use data ourselves. And question the presentation of it when it is made visible for political reasons. The influence of emancipatory critical educators such as John Dewey (1933\/1998) Paulo Freire (1997\/ 2000; 1998) is evident here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sources:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bach, B., Wang, Z., Farinella, M., Murray-Rust, D. and Henry Riche, N., 2018, April.
